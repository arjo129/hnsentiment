'I&#x27;m happy to be harsh because I&#x27;ve had years and years of experience dealing with IBM.<p>Their tools are trash for the cost they want. The majority of their offerings are overengineered and prone to failure in a production setting.<p>They are pros at selling to non-technical management, all the while IT employees get stuck dealing with the aftermath.<p>We ended up getting stuck with the IBM version of work item management, called Jazz Team Concert. From the &quot;source control&quot; to the actual setup and configuration, the product was a nightmare. The worst part was when we looked at license renewal. They wanted three quarters of a million dollars for something that was essentially dog shit wrapped in cat shit.<p>In case you thought I might be on the fence with IBM, I&#x27;ll add one final clarifying point:<p>Fuck IBM.'
