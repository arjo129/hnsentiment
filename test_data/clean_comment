"I'm happy to be harsh because I've had years and years of experience dealing with IBM.Their tools are trash for the cost they want. The majority of their offerings are overengineered and prone to failure in a production setting.They are pros at selling to non-technical management, all the while IT employees get stuck dealing with the aftermath.We ended up getting stuck with the IBM version of work item management, called Jazz Team Concert. From the \"source control\" to the actual setup and configuration, the product was a nightmare. The worst part was when we looked at license renewal. They wanted three quarters of a million dollars for something that was essentially dog shit wrapped in cat shit.In case you thought I might be on the fence with IBM, I'll add one final clarifying point:Fuck IBM."
